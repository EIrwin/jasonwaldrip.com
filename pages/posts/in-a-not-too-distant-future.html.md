# In a Not Too Distant Future

## 2084

A young boy walks into a room, the year is 2084. The room is bursting with energy. In it there are students roaming
about and a few instructors in the mix as well. The students have been tasked with completing a math problem. But
instead of working on this problem in solitude, the students are actively helping each other. This is not what anyone
has told them to do but rather a side effect of their environment. In this world, there are no grades, in fact there
is no social hierarchy of any kind. The students simply know that intelligent peers benefit the whole.

The boy enjoying a long day at school, rides his bike home. On the way home, the boy hit a curb, rendering his bike
unusable, and forcing him to walk the remaining quarter mile. When he gets home he is greeted by his mother, and the
boy tells her about his unfortunate incident. His mother quickly pulls up designs for a number of bikes, the boy
chooses one, and a device called a 3D printer located in the families garage uses raw materials to create a new bike.
The family payed only for the raw material and the design, which coincidentally was created by a 16 year old girl
just a few blocks away.


The very next day, the boys mother heads off to what we would call in present time a "job". Although unlike our
present day jobs, people do what they enjoy. People in this time are called "craftsmen", each of them require a
certain un-exploitable experience and or skill. Most of the craftsmen in this time are  what we would consider to be
Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, Doctors, Chefs, Artists, or Musicians in the present day. What people create
is ultimately owned and accessible to anyone who wishes to change or modify the original idea. There are no patents,
no intellectual property what-so-ever therefor allowing innovation to happen quickly and iteratively.

You make think im crazy but lets rewind and explain how we got here.

## 2014

### Health Care Reform

The year is ripe with social change. First off the #{ link_to 'Affordable Care Act', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act' }
is first and foremost holding insurance companies accountable fo the health of their customers. Over the last century
these companies have exploited healthy people and not provided care for those who needed it most. Although people in
positions of power and significant stake in the old ways are quick to resist such change, it is the citizens and
people who ultimately want this change.

### Finance

The financial world is being disrupted as well. A new currency, dubbed #{ link_to 'BitCoin', 'http://bitcoin.org/en/' }
decentralized from the control of the worlds government and banks; has taken a strong foothold in the economy. People
all over the world are now buying and selling goods using this new currency. On January 1st, 2014 1 BitCoin or BTC was
worth 225 USD. BitCoin by design has no way of being centralized or controlled, it is a form of pure monetary trade in
a digital form.

Also this year, the
[JOBS (Jumpstart our Business Startup)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpstart_Our_Business_Startups_Act)
act goes into full effect. This means that any individual regardless of social status or income can invest and profit
from new ideas by investing in private businesses. Previously a law in place since 1929, prevented such trading in
private companies unless certain wage requirements and other criteria were met. Trading in public companies was still
possible as individuals, but the right to be publicly traded in itself was only held by companies that had the means
and capital to do so. With this new law, anyone can create and fund a new idea from non other than their peers.

### Industrial Design

Several innovations have been made in Industrial Design that have started to flourish in 2014. One of the most notable
is the advancements in #{ link_to '3D printing', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing' }. Although the technology
has been around for almost half a decade, its advancements and increased use in industrial design are proving to show
that it can be applied to literally build anything. For example, researchers at the University of Southern California
have designed a printer that can literally print a house. Most of the materials found in most engineered objects today
can be printed.The advancements in 3D printing mean that jobs previously require a worker, now just require a design
and the materials in order to bring that design to fruition.
